# db-name-standard
Example of a feasible database name convention tested in different real situations.

Version: v1.0.0

This name convetion has been tested in a DataWarehouse and also in different app databases in real production environtments.

Some of the advantatges of a naming convention are:

1.to provide additional information (i.e., metadata) about the use to which an identifier is put;
2.to help formalize expectations and promote consistency within a development team;
3.to enable the use of automated refactoring or search and replace tools with minimal potential for error;
4.to enhance clarity in cases of potential ambiguity;
5.to enhance the aesthetic and professional appearance of work product (for example, by disallowing overly long names, comical or 
  "cute" names, or abbreviations);
6.to help avoid "naming collisions" that might occur when the work product of different organizations is combined (see also: 
  namespaces);
7.to provide meaningful data to be used in project handovers which require submission of program source code and all relevant    
  documentation;
8.to provide better understanding in case of code reuse after a long interval of time.
